# /synapse:dispatch - Direct Workflow Coordination Communication

## Description

Direct communication channel with the DISPATCHER agent for workflow coordination, task management, and system orchestration. This command provides immediate access to workflow expertise for project coordination and process optimization.

## Agent Target

**DISPATCHER** - Workflow coordination and task management

## Implementation

When `/synapse:dispatch` is invoked:

1. **Direct Connection**: Establish direct communication with DISPATCHER agent
2. **Workflow Context**: Load current workflow state and project coordination needs
3. **Coordination Expertise**: Provide specialized workflow management guidance
4. **Process Optimization**: Analyze and improve development processes
5. **Resource Management**: Coordinate agent assignments and resource allocation
6. **Bottleneck Resolution**: Identify and resolve workflow inefficiencies

### Example Usage

```
/synapse:dispatch How should we coordinate the frontend and backend development streams?
```

```
/synapse:dispatch Can you help prioritize these competing feature requests?
```

```
/synapse:dispatch What's the best approach for managing dependencies in this complex release?
```

## Integration with Workflow

While `/synapse:dispatch` provides direct access, for formal coordination:
1. Use `/synapse:plan` for systematic planning and task breakdown
2. Use `/synapse:implement` and `/synapse:review` for execution
3. Use `/synapse:dispatch` for coordination challenges and optimization
4. Leverage workflow management commands for ongoing coordination
